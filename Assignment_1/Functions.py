# if current node is not a leaf (impurity > 0(?)), generate all valid splits


# deal with nmin and minleaf

    # implement the gini-index

        # calculate the impurity reductions

        # compute the best split


        # --- Jens
        # generate the nodes given by the best split and divide the cases accordingly

        # call again tree_grow() until each node is processed (nodelist empty, as slides)





# create tree_pred()





# create tree_grow_b()



# create tree_pred_b()
