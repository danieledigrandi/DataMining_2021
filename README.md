# DataMining_2021

This repository contains the implemented solutions and reports for both the assignments of the course "Data Mining" (2021).

The first assignment consists of manually implement a decision tree classifier and random forest classifier to analysing data of an application's bugs in order to predict whether a bug will arise given certain features.

The second assignment consists of analysing hotel reviews with different classifiers (decision tree, random forest, multinomial naive bayes, logistic regression) in order to understand and predict whether an hotel review is real (truthful) or fake (deceptive), and compare the performance of the utilised classifiers to understand which one is best.

A detailed description of the assignments can be found in the respective folders.
